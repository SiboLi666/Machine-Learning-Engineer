# Machine-Learning-Engineer - Udacity Nanodegree
This repository contains the lecture notes, practices and projects for Udacity's Machine learning nanodegree which I started working on since Feb. 2020.

## Project 1: Python package building
Build a python package including Gaussian distribution and Binomial classes.

## Project2: Building models using sagemaker
- Construct a model using XGBoost to perform Boston housing price prediction.
- Construct a model using XGBoost to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.

## Project3: Implement two machine learning models based on deep convolutional neural network to perform dog breed classification.
